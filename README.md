Spyglass
========

OpenCV in Ruby, made simple.

Why?
====

Because I've been working on a computer vision project for 2 months and missed Ruby. Also, I wanted a nice, coherent API that would make me happy to use.

Requirements
============

This gem requires OpenCV 2.4.5 or better. For an in-depth OpenCV installation guide, refer to the [OpenCV Wiki page](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide). It also depends on `pkg-config` being installed. I'm also accepting pull requests for Windows.

TODO
====

There is a lot left to implement, as I've really only ported the parts of the API that I've used so far. Apart from that, there's:

* Documentation
* More tests
